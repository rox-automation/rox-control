### Changed
- **Build system modernization**: Migrated from Docker-based build to native `uv` tooling

  - Track class now only contains generally useful path tracking methods (`find_closest_segment()`)  
  - Pure pursuit specific lookahead logic encapsulated in controller for better reusability
  - Enables Track reuse for other controllers like Stanley without coupling to pure pursuit concepts
  - File renamed from `tracks.py` to `track.py` for singular naming consistency

  - Animation control methods now have complete type annotations
  - Docstring formatting standardized according to project guidelines

### Added
- **Local CI infrastructure**: Docker-based continuous integration for consistent testing
  - `ci/Dockerfile` and `ci/scripts/run-ci.sh` for containerized CI execution
  - `invoke ci` task for running full CI pipeline locally
  - Pre-commit hook integration with pytest for automated testing

### Fixed
- **Print statement cleanup**: Removed debugging print statements from simulation code
- **Test stability**: Improved controller test reliability and reduced test complexity
- **Subsampling parameters**: Enhanced `print_states_table` with configurable row limiting

## [0.2.0] - 2025-06-17

  - Main `generate_track(track_type: str, **kwargs) -> Track` function
  - Square track generation with 5 waypoints (4 corners + closing point)
  - Circular track generation with configurable radius, center, and resolution
  - Figure-8 track generation with configurable size and resolution
  - Parameter validation with clear error messages for invalid inputs
  - Full integration with existing Track class from feat_003

  - Velocity-projected pure pursuit algorithm with proportional control
  - `PurePursuitA` class with configurable parameters (lookahead, gain, speed)
  - `ControlOutput` dataclass with structured control commands and debug info
  - `set_track()` and `control()` methods for clean stateful interface
  - Projects robot future position using velocity vector before path projection
  - Uses `point_on_line` for accurate segment projection and lookahead targeting
  - Handles track completion and edge cases (empty tracks, beyond end)
  - Full integration with existing `Track` and `RobotState` types
  - Comprehensive test suite with 16 test methods covering unit and integration scenarios
  - 96% test coverage (47/49 statements)

### Changed
- **Visualization architecture refactored** (feat_008)
  - Moved `SimulationData` and `SimulationState` classes to `src/tools/simulation.py`
  - Changed `RobotState` from `NamedTuple` to `@dataclass` for cleaner inheritance
  - `SimulationState` extends `RobotState` with optional debug data (`controller_output`, `projected_path`)
  - Unified plotting interface: `plot_simulation_data(data, animate=False/True)` for both static and animated plots
  - True decoupling: debug data populated during simulation, not post-visualization calculation
- **Animation enhancements**
  - Left plot now uses full vertical space while maintaining aspect ratio
  - Robot position marker and heading vector changed from blue to green
  - Velocity and steering plots scaled to 110% of simulation data maximum values
  - Track transparency set to 50% for better trajectory visibility
  - Heading arrow now extends from robot position to front wheel position
  - Removed separate front wheel position marker for cleaner visualization
